## The World
Every technology of our world is infused with and maintained by elemental stones. These stones contain incredible powers that, once harnessed, provide the energy necessary to fuel our Magic-Punk society, a Steampunk-inspired environment powered by magic. While the world's inhabitants cannot tap into these powers on their own, they must channel them through special weapons. Some inhabitants seek to use these powers to protect their homelands, while others seek only chaos. Will you choose to defend your home from malicious forces, or let chaos overrun?

## Cast and Characters
Many inhabitants seek to protect their lands from invading forces. A choice few have risen to gaurd their homes and devote their lives to this cause:

Others who seek the stones' power for their own use care little for the resulting ramifications. The world's destruction pales in comparison to the promise of ultimtate control for these characters:

## Gameplay
*VGDC_RPG_2015* is a Magic-Punk Tactical RPG inspired by the turn-based strategy gameplay of *Fire Emblem*, *Shining Force*, and *Final Fantasy Tactics*. Two opposing teams each of four units compete on various battlefields for domination. Players assign units elemental stones that modify their base stats, with different elemental types that both buff and debuff particular arttributes. **Note:** The stone you choose for a player unit becomes the same for its enemy variant (e.g. if the player selected the wind stone for Mittens, then E.R.S. would also get the wind stone).

Battles are either **Player vs. Player** or **Player vs. AI**. Challenge your friends in local multiplayer or against the computer in two randomly generated map variants!

## Combat and Controls
Combat operates on an initiative-based unit system. Characters with higher initiatives will move first, so no one team will all act in succession. For each unit, players can either select Move, Attack, Inventory or End.

**Move** will display the available movement tiles for that unit; select a tile to move to that location.

**Attack** displays the available attack tiles, which vary in size between ranged and melee-based units. The **Grenadier** class is a special type of ranged attacker that performs splash damage when a player clicks a tile surrounding multiple units. Damage is calculated as normal at the selected space, and decreasing fallout damage is calculated for each tile farther out.

**Inventory** lets a player select an item from their current inventory. Select the **Potion** icon to heal for 10 HP.

**End** Ends the current unit's turn. This additionally applies to attacking or using an item.

Hold the **right-mouse** button and drag to pan the battlefield. You can also zoom in/out using the **mouse scroll wheel** and adjust the graphics settings by pressing **ESC**.
